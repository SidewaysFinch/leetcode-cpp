# 1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum/

## Brief

You have `d` dice and each die has `f` faces numbered `1, 2, ..., f`.

Return the number of possible ways (out of `f^d` total ways) **modulo** 109 + 7 to roll the dice so the sum of the face-up numbers equals `target`.
