# 910. Smallest Range II

Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-range-ii/

## Brief

Given an array `nums` of integers, for each integer `nums[i]` we need to choose **either** `x = -k` **or** `x = k`, and add `x` to `nums[i]` (only once).

After this process, we have some array `result`.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value of `result` and the minimum value of `result`.
